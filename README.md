# Code Challenges

In this repository I will publish my solutions for some code challenges.

## Daily Coding Problem
### My Solutions

In the folder `daily-coding-problem/solutions` I'm trying to solve all the callenges that [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com) sends me each day.

Each file name represents the number of the problem (i.e. `1.py` stands for **Problem #1**).

Currenly I am only developing solutions with Python but I'd like to try it out with other programming languages (e.g. Go, Haskell, JavaScript, etc).

Solutions I am providing are most focused on elegance and readability but I will provide solutions focused on efficiency. Solutions focused on efficiency will have the following filename pattern: `eff<#>` where `<#>` is the number of the problem.

## Project Euler
### My Solutions

In the folder `project-euler/solutions` I'm trying to solve all the callenges that I have found on the website of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

Each file name represents the ID of the problem (i.e. `1.py` stands for **Problem 1**).
